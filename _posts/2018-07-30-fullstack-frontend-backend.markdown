If you are a developer, you probably ask this question before: "be a fullstack, be frontend or be backend?". If you didn't found an answer yet.

I hope to help you a little to make the right choise.  Well,  nowadays companies search for fullstack profile, ok, let's define what means been fullstack?.


Fullstack developer is who sometimes  create the layout for a web page and sometimes  need to build all its functionality, so, he/she probably needs to know/work with the following technologies:

- SASS/LESS
- Jquery
- HTML
- PHP/JAVA/PHYTON (Backend)
- Other technologies you want to mention!

But the handicap been a fullstack developer, is that you probably are not good enough  in back or front, because these profiles tends to be more efficient doing backend or more frontend, and not both
of them at the same time.

Anyway, is true that backend profile should know HTML, Javascript and little CSS, because sometimes when you maintain a project, you need to use CSS, for example: the client needs to change text position of paragraphs.
In that case you need to know the main css properties.


So, finally, focus in one technology, but don't to learn a little back (is you are frontend) or front (if you are backend).
